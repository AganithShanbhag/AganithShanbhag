(EGYPT: President Sadat's address to the nation
last night was primarily a fence-mending effort designed to mollify and undercut domestic and foreign--
primarily Soviet--opponents of his recent policy innovations. At the same time, he made no apologies
for those policies and made it clear that he will
pursue them. Although generally circumspect toward
the US, Sadat made some uncharacteristically benevolent statements, reflecting a guarded optimism that
Washington intends some action to break the Middle
East impasse.
The most dramatic portion of the speech, made
on the anniversary of President Nasir's death, came
at its conclusion when Sadat announced an amnesty
for a group of students arrested during demonstrations early this year, as well as the reinstatement
of a large number of journalists purged for their
leftist views. The conciliatory gestures are designed to head off the possibility of further student disturbances when the school year opens next
month, to answer legitimate student grievances, and
to give substance to Sadat's moves toward social
liberalization.
On the subject of his domestic and foreign
policy reforms, Sadat, in essence, invoked the
memory of Nasir to support his program of change
away from Nasirism and socialism. Noting that one
of Nasirism's most important characteristics is
"its ability to respond to constant movement," Sadat
explained his own policy of "evolution" as both
based on his predecessor's movement and unique in
itself. Although intending to ease the misgivings
of remaining Nasir devotees, Sadat could not resist
the temptation to emphasize the greater merit of
his own program over Nasir's; his government has
proved, he said, "that the man came from the nation,
and not the nation from the man."

C Although Sadat derided the US for supporting
Israel and echoed his usual rejection of an interim
agreement to reopen the Suez Canal and institute
a partial Israeli withdrawal, he expressed pleased
surprise at Secretary of State Kissinger's meeting
on 25 September with Arab representatives at the UN.
Sadat noted that Egypt has already made its position
clear to the US, but he did not use the occasion to
spell out the controversial specifics of that position. Sadat remains skeptical of US intentions,
but his approach reflects a sense of expectation
toward possible US moves on the Arab-Israeli conflict
and a desire to avoid dampening prospects for movement. He made a point of noting at the end of his
speech that he had deliberately avoided rhetoric on
"the battle."
Sadat took a balanced approach toward Egypt's
delicate relations with the USSR. Without ever
mentioning the Soviets directly, he explained policy
changes that have been disturbing Moscow in terms
intended to ease Soviet misgivings, but he did not
give any indication that he plans to alter his new
moves away from socialism. Sadat is not a friend
of the Soviets, but he wants to maintain good relations with them, and he has been at pains, since
initiating his policy realignment in July, to portray the Soviets as political allies.
This relaxed attitude has met with a testy
Soviet reaction. Moscow is apprehensive at the implication of adat's moves for its interests in
the area, 25X1

ARAB STAT''ES - ISRAEL: After three days of heavy
fighting, Israsl has regained most of the territory
it lost to Syria in the Golan Heights, and has contained Egyptian forces to a narrow area along the
east bank of the Suez Canal. No otler Arab states
have become significantly involved in the fighting.
Syrian forces dealt heavy blows to Israeli outposts in the Golan Heights after fighting broke out
in the early afternoon of 6 October. Syria breached
Israeli lines at two points, captured the town of
Qunaytirah, and for a time held considerable territory in the 6entral sector.. By early this morning,
Israeli forces had recaptured almost all territory
up to the previous cease-fire lines, and--according
to Israeli accounts--had surrounded some Syrian units.
Losses have been substantial on both sides. The Israelis have admitted losing at least 35 aircraft and
150 tanks. in the Golan battle alone. Syrian tank
losses are placed at 300 by the Israelis, who claim
to have destroyed 37 Syrian aircraft in yesterday's
fighting.
On the Sinai front, fighting was initially less
intense. The Israelis apparently were satisfied to
contain the Egyptian thrust while dealing with the
more pressing situation on the Golan Heights. The
Egyptians. succeeded in putting as many as 11 bridges
across the canal, some of which were still in use
early this morning. As many as five Egyptian infantry divisions and 600-700 tanks have moved into the
Sinai, according to Israeli accounts. The Israelis
now claim to have hemmed in this force, but acknowledge that removing it will be a formidable task.
Contrary to their public statements, the Egyptians
have not made a concerted effort to strike into the
Sinai, suggesting that their strategy may be to take
and hold a relatively small area with a view to its
political rather than military 'advantages .
King Husayn of Jordan continues to resist the
pressures of other Arab leaders, ranging from Libya's President Qadhafi to Saudi Arabia's King Faysal, t enter the battle.

Few Arab states have contributed meaningful
assistance to Syria or Egypt, although most have
placed thoir military forces' on alert and: applauded
initial 'Syrian and Egyptian successes. Sudan, Morocco, Tunisia, Kuwait, and zraq have sent or promised to send soldiers to the front, but these troops
will not make an irmpact on the military .situation.
Some fedayeen forces have been active in southern
Lebanon, but these have been more an irritant than
a threat to Israel. Zgebanon has provided token humanitariai assistance to Egypt, but its modest army is concentrated around Beirut and is deployed in
Such a way as to guard against fedayeen-inspired
domestic trouble rather than an Israeli attack.
The -Soviet Union has -given political support to
the Arab cause, but has not made any moves to suggest
it intends to become involved in the military action.
In remarks yesterday, party chief Brezhnev placed the
blame for the fighting on Israel, but offered only
"sympathy" for the Arabs and reiterated Soviet support for a political settlement.. Soviet officials
have stressed that the present situation must not
jeopardize the general .improvement in US-soviet relations. .

CARAB STATES ISRAEL: Israeli forces encountered
stiff resistance yesterday on the .Golan Heights, but
advanced past the 1967 cease-fire line. Fighting on
the Egyptian front was more sporadic with neither
side committing enough manpower to seriously challenge
the other's position.
Israeli ground forces pushed about 11 kilometers
beyond the 1967 cease-fire line, along a narrow front
between Mount Hermon and Qunaytirah in the northern
Golan Heights, yesterday afternoon,. _
the likely Israeli target in Syria will be Qatana,
about 20 kilometers
southwest o Damascus. Israeli aircraft continued
to pound Syrian positions last night and this morning,
especially on the flanks of the most advanced Israeli
units. Israeli aircraft attacked Damascus international airport and seven other nearby Syrian airfields
yesterday. Five Israeli planes were lost as a result
of ground fire--probably SA-6 missiles. Syria reported Israeli naval units and helicopters attacked
the port of Tartus shortly before midnight last night.
Damascus claimed to have destroyed three Israeli boats
and a helicopter in this engagement. A Soviet merchant vessel was struck by two missiles, but no casualties were reported.
The situation in the Sinai remains relatively
unchanged. The Egyptians have not made a serious attempt to expand their positions on the east bank of
the canal nor have they launched a major drive eastward toward the Sinai passes. The Israeli Air Force
continues to attack Egyptian positions along the
canal; .over 120 sorties were flown yesterday and
several aircraft were lost to round fire. Only a
few Egyptian fighters were flying--none
were seen over the east ban . small Egyptian
thrust to move away from the canal was made south
of Suez City, but apparently was turned back by the
Israelis.

Moscow is keeping in close diplomatic touch with
the Arab states and probably is 'receiving pressure
for additional assistance. Soviet Foreign Minister
Gromyko met with several Arab ambassadors in'Moscow
yesterday and accepted their thanks for Soviet support.
Gromyko told the envoys that the USSR "will exert all
efforts" on behalf of a Middle East peace that safeguards the security of all countries in the region.
The Iraqi Foreign Minister was in Moscow on 9-10 October. He said the visit was for consultations on
"important joint matters" in accordance with the
Iraqi-Soviet friendship treaty. The discussions probably centered on Soviet logistic support for the
Iraqi war effort.
The deployment of Arab troops from countries other
than Syria and Egypt appears to be increasing.. Some
countries such as Kuwait and the Sudan have announced
token contributions, but as many as 16,000 Iraqi troops
and more than 100 tanks were reported to have crossed
into' Syria yesterday. These numbers cannot be confirmed but it is apparent that Baghdad is becoming
increasingly involved in the fighting. Iraqi Armed
Forces Headquarters announced yesterday that Iraqi
planes and tanks have joined other Arab forces on the
battlefront. The statement also admits the loss of
12 planes and lists the names of Iraqi pilots killed
in action.

stationed in southern Jordan. King Hassan has announced that a contin ent of Moroccan troops is en
route t Egypt.
Morocco already had 2,000-3,000
troops in Syria before the outbreak of hostilities.
According to a Moroccan Foreign Ministry spokesman,
this contingent has taken heavy casualties on the Golan
Heights. The willingness of other Arab states to make
these sacrifices will place increased pressure on
Jordan's King Husayn to take a more active role in
the hostilities.
Lebanon, however, continues to show no interest
in getting involved in the fighting. In a statement
to the press today, the Defense Minister stressed
Lebanon's defensive posture. He avoided any suggestion that the Lebanese might initiate a diversionary
action against Israel, but emphasized that the army
is ready to "frustrate any aggression." With regard
to Lebanon's relations with the Palestinian guerrillas,
the Defense Minister asserted that fedayeen leaders
had shown "understanding" toward the government, an
apparent allusion to the limited involvement in the
war of Lebanon-based guerrillas. Some of the fedayeen have engaged in minor cross-border operations
into Israel.
Although pleasantly surprised about Egyptian
military success, Yasir Arafat and some fedayeen
leaders are less happy about the possible political
imalictions of the war,
Arafat is said to fear that a likely outcome
o thefighting-in which the fedayeen role has been
minimal--will be the eclipse of Fatah and the PFLP.
Arafat is also critical of what he believes to be
Sadat's strategy, that is, that Cairo will be content
to occupy only a limited amount of territory in the
Sinai.while anticipating great power intervention.
Arafat hopes to crank up the fedayeen propaganda
machine to urge the Arab states not to accept a ceasefire and to fight a war of "total liberation."

- ARAB 'STATES ISRAEL: The Israelis are making hard-won advances in the Golan Heights and in their
efforts to penetrate into Syria. There is little
action in the Sinai.
Heavy fighting on the Golan Heights died- down
last night with Israeli forces about 12 miles beyond
the cease-fire line, but unable to achieve.a decisive
breakthrough on the road to Damascus. In the southern sector of the Heights, the Syrians claim to have
made advances, and may have overrun a UN observation
post early yesterday. The area was relatively quiet later in the day, however, with indications that the
Israelis may have retaken the post and were slightly
beyond the cease-fire line. The Syrians are reportedly withdrawing tank units from the front and deploying them to a second defense line nearer Damascus.
For the first time, Damascus has acknowledged publicly that Israeli troops have made progress on the
"war's northern front." In air activity, the Israelis
made over 400 sorties yesterday, making it the heaviest day of the war. Despite this intense activity
and their own heavy losses in dogfights, the Syrians
continued throughout most of the day to fly ground=
support.missions.
Activity on the Sinai front yesterday was limited to artillery exchanges and a reduced number of
Israeli air strikes. Neither side claimed significant advances, and neither suffered serious losses.
Early yesterday the Israelis charged that the Egyptians had moved four SAM batteries to the east side
of the canal, but today they reported that
they had determined
that the resumed SAMs were dummies.
the Egyptians mounted helicopter assaults at three points on the Sinai coast, including
Abu Rudesis, where a limited number of Egyptian troops
and a helicopter pilot were captured. |

three areas--Port Said, Ismailia, and Dumyat--to decide on the positioning of surface-to-surface mis- i
siles.

The Soviet for example,
that it was important ror the two superpowers to remain friends and
not permit the Arab-Israeli war to alter the relationship developed over the past year. Soviet
took a similar line
wit their US counterparts the same day, indicating
that the Soviets have used a circular diplomatic message to instruct their representatives along these
lines. The Soviet said that both
sides would be obliged to resupply their allies with
war materiel, but that this should not affect relations between the US and USSR. The Soviets are also
querying US officials on the possible nature of the
US effort in behalf of Israel, including the possible
introduction of US military personnel and the resupply
of F-4 Phantom fighter aircraft.
A carefully worded TASS statement of 12 October
that protested Israeli attacks on the Soviet Cultural
Center in Damascus and a Soviet merchant vessel in a
Syrian port testifies to Moscow's concern over possible sources of pressure on the USSR to increase its
own involvement. The statement noted that the "Soviet
people" (not the Soviet Government) strongly condemned
Israeli bombing of civilian targets; .a TASS statement
is of course less authoritative than a govermental one.
TASS warned, however, that the USSR cannot regard Israeli actions "indifferently" and that Israel's continued failure to observe international law "will
lead to grave consequences."

Arab-Israeli Hostilities:.. Two Scenarios
The Arab-Israeli war is approaching a decisive turning
point. Because of the lack of detailed information concerning several critical variables, it is impossible to predict
with great confidence how events on the battlefield will
develop. We have, however, in this paper constructed what
seem to be the most likely alternative scenarios and their
implications.
Scenario. I: Israeli Retribution
Introduction
When the fighting began on Saturday, the Israeli reserves
were not mobilized. Only blocking forces were deployed in the
areas where the Syrians and the Egyptians attacked. Israel's
strategy was to hold on until their mobilized strength could
be pressed against the Arabs.. This strategy appears to be
working. The small number of Israeli. troops initially deployed
on the Golan Heights held long enough for the mobilized force
to get into position and the tide of battle has turned in
Israel's favor. Along the Suez Canal, the Bar Lev defense
line has done the job of tripping the Egyptian offensive. The
attacking Egyptian forces have not driven deep into the Sinai.
The Israeli strategy at this point appears to be to destroy the Syrian military forces while simply containing the
large Egyptian force that has crossed over to the east bank
of the Suez Canal. Once the job on the Syrian front is completed--probably within a few days--the Israelis will most
likely attempt to launch a major offensive against the
Egyptians.
Assessment at Mid-Week
On the Golan Heights, the Syrians have fought better than
anticipated. To stop the drive, the Israelis relied primarily
on their air power, but this has proved to be costly in aircraft losses. Time was bought, however, and sufficient armor

strength is now in the area for the Israelis to press the
counterattack across the 1967 cease-fire line and on to
Damascus. The highest Israeli priority will be the destruction of the Syrian forces rather. than additional territorial
gains.
In the Sinai, the overall levelof action has been less
intense. The Egyptians moved quickly and. easily. across the
Canal and were able to rapidly establish several bridgeheads.
The Israeli forces along the Canal itself at the time numbered
only a few thousand men, equipped with .about two .hundred tanks.
- -These outnumbered units fought a delaying action before being
forced to abandon virtually all the Bar Lev Line. outposts on
the east bank of the canal.
Israel's main force in Sinai has not yet been committed,
however. It now appears that..the Israelis are holding back
until the reserves from Israel can link up. When all is in
place, the Israelis will strike back with a counterattack
intended to destroy the Egyptians forces now in Sinai.
- Israel's Capability to Do It
The major determining factor in the overall strategy is
whether Israel still has the strength to launch major counterattacks. Because the Arabs have fought well, Israel's .losses
have been higher than anticipated. Measured against the .size
of the total .force, however, it still appears that the Israelis
have sufficient numbers of aircraft, tanks, and men to achieve
their objective--to roll back the attackers to the 1967 line
and destroy the attacking Syrian and Egyptian forces.
A Jordanian entry into the war would draw off Israel's
strength from the Syrian front. The Israelis can probably
handle the Jordanian forces without heavy losses, but they
would be forced to alter the timetable of.their plans on the
other more important fronts.
Israel's aircraft losses are probably the most serious
element in the equation. About 100 planes have been lost
out of Israel's total. inventory of some 350 combat aircraft.
The Israelis reportedly have now cleared most of the SAM
defenses from the Golan Heights; unless the Syrians receive
major re-supply of SAM's Israeli aircraft losses probably
will be low on the Syrian front.
' 2
PPROVED FOR RELEASE - CIA INFO DATE: 15-Oct- 012
On the Egyptian front, the Israelis can expect to lose
more planes. Egypt's SAM defenses are still largely in place
and only a small part of its air force has been committed.
Once the Israelis begin counterattacking in force, however,
the totgl strength of the Egyptian air force should enter the
battle. To conserve their aircraft, the Israelis may rely on
their armor to destroy the Egyptian forces in Sinai.
In terms of tanks, the Israelis have lost some 600
tanks. Although their loss is about 30 percent of the total
tank inventory, the Israelis have more tanks now than they
did when. the 1967 war broke out. In the absence of a new
threat on the Eastern Front, the Israelis have sufficient
ground and air combat strength to destroy the Egyptian forces
in the Sinai. The Israelis also may decide to cross the Canal
to destroy the remaining elements of the Egyptian Army, even
at the expense of heavy casualties.
And finally manpower. The Israelis may. have suffered
losses of more than 1,000 men--already several hundred more
than were lost in the Six Day War. This is still a .small
percentage of Israel's entire mobilized force of some 300,000
men, however. Manpower losses are not. likely to be a determining factor in Israeli strategy at this stage of the war.
The losses will only fill the Israelis with greater resolve
to strike back hard.
Conclusion
In the Israeli mind, this war is the "Day of Judgment
War". It has become a no-holds-barred affair., and the
Israelis are determined to punish the Arabs. Chief of Staff
David Elezar has said that the objective now is to "break
their bones."
Given this mental state, the Israelis probably are
willing to pay the high cost in men and equipment necessary
to demonstrate the consequences of attacking Israel. This
war is becoming .increasingly bloody, and from Israel's point
of view, cannot continue over a long period of time.

Scenario II: Stalemate
Introduction.
Each day that goes by without significant Israeli success
in defeating or dislodging the Egyptian forces from the east
bank of the Suez Canal strengthens the Arab resolve and increases the possibility of additional Arab.forces joining the
war. The prospects that the Egyptians will be able to continue to hold their positions on the Suez Canal over.the
next week are fair to gaad, and, as time elapses, the Egyptians probably will become stronger and extend their positions
even deeper into Israeli-held territory. The factors favoring the Egyptians are:
-- the momentum derived from the success thus far of.
attacking the.Israelis without instant defeat and disastrous lo.sses
-- the sheer weight of .numerical advantage in equipment
and manpower;
*-- the climate of international opinion, especially
African and Western European;
- a much improved air defense- system that has denied
the Israelis the kind of complete air superiority they
had in 1967;
-- a better logistic situation than that of the Israelis;
,N
-- the prospects of the support of other Arab countries
in terms of men, equipment, and supplies;
-- the option of using oil for political leverage.
Momentum
It has taken the Israelis five days of very heavy fighting to dislodge the Syrians from the Golan Heights and they
have thus far been unable to turn back the Egyptians forces
occupying the east bank of .the Canal. Both the Arabs and
Israelis have sustained heavy losses, but the impact of these
losses appears to be greater on Israel than on the Arabs
because the Israeli manpower and equipment base is much
smaller. The Israelis appear to have lost about 30 percent
.. 4
fS cRE
PPROVED FOR RELEASE - CIA INFO DATE: 15-Oct-2012
of . their tanks and nearly 25 percent of their aircraft. Other
Arab countries, however, have significant quantities of both
that gA 1,e made available to Egypt and Syria..
Although .the Syrians have been dislodged from .the Golan
heights, the fighting in that area has required the commitment of large quantities of Israeli resources. The Israelis,
however, will probably have to maintain large parts of their
ground forces in this area in the event the Syrians, either
by themselves or with reinforcements from other Arabs,. launch
a counterattack. The fact that the Syrians have successfully
tied up a substantial portion of the Israeli forces for about
five days -has no't only given the Arabs a crucial boost in
morale, but has facilitated the Egyptian operation to place
and maintain troops into the Sinai.
On the Suez Canal front, the Israelis claim the Egyptians
have put some 40,000 troops and 700-800 tanks across the canal
into the Sinai. The Israelis have put some of the tanks out
of operation but they have not been successful in knocking
- out the bridges across the canal. They concede that the
Egyptians continue to-reinforce .their bri'dgeheads.
Numbers
Egypt and Syria together have greater quantities of
military equipment than Israel. When war broke out, Egypt
and Syria had a 2:1 edge in tank inventory and a 2.5:1.edge
in aircraft inventory over the Israelis. After nearly a.week.
of fighting, both sides have sustained. heavy losses, but the
ratio of inventories.has shifted slightly in favor of the
Egyptians and Syrians. Those. Arab countries now hold a 2.15:1
edge in tanks. and 1.65:1 edge in aircraft. Other Arab countries that are not now directly involved in the fighting have
significant quantities of equipment that can be .made available
to Egypt and Syria.
The implication of this kind of Arab superiority in
equipment is that the Arabs.can afford heavier losses than
the Israelis. In fact, Arab losses have been only slightly
higher than those. of the Israelis--certainly in a much smaller
ratio. than the equipment holdings at the beginning of.the war.
If the two -sides were to continue to .suffer losses at the present rate for a period of a few weeks, the attrition would
be far more serious for the Israelis than the Arabs.

Equipment
The Egyptians and Syrians have greatly improved their air
defense networks. Large quantities of sophisticated SAM equipment have been sent to and deployed in both countries. Although the Israelis may ultimately be able to neutralize these
systems, the Israeli loss of aircraft will be high.
Pilot and equipment fatigue is another important factor.
The Israelis have been logging long hours in the. air while
the Arabs and especially the Egyptians have committed relatively few of their aircraft to the battle.
Logistics
Although the evidence is not firm, there are indications
that the Arabs are in a better supply position for ammunition
and petroleum than Israel. The Israelis reportedly are seeking additional supplies of 105 mm and 155 mm ammunition.
Conversely, the Egyptians are expending ammunition and .missiles
at a rate that suggests to the Israelis that there is no
shortage. Furthermore, at least 33 Soviet military-related
AN-12s have flown to Syria in the past several days and five
AN-22s have gone to Egypt, all probably with military supplies.
Additional AN-12s are scheduled to fly to Egypt.
Support by Other Arab Countries
As the fighting rages, other Arab countries are showing
signs of supporting the. Egyptians and Syrians. Although the
individual contributions may not be large, commulatively they
could be significant. If the present combatants are able to
continue the battle and are not defeated by the Israelis, the
other Arabs could become infected with the smell of victory
and join in..
The Libyans still have about 60 Mirage aircraft in their
inventory, and there is evidence that a few of these have
been made available to Egypt. The Moroccans have announced
that they will send another 2,500 or so troops to the fighting. Baghdad has indicated that it will provide SU-7s and
MIG-21s to the Syrian front and perhaps as many as 16,000
Iraqi troops and.100 tanks are on their way to Syria. Algeria
has sent air units to Egypt. Saudi Arabia reportedly intends
to send a combat brigade to Syria and may provide some aircraft. Tunisia, Sudan, and Kuwait reportedly have provided
small elements to the fighting, or may do so.

If support comes to Egypt and Syria from virtually all
of the Arab countries, it is going to be difficult for King
Husayn to remain on the sidelines. This is especially true
if the Arabs continue to be able to prevent a total defeat
by the :srael.is. A decision by Husayn to enter the fighting
on the side of the Arabs would place a good deal of pressure
on the Israelis.
Conclusion
The Arabs are approaching the point where, if they are
willing to pay the price, they might be able to wear down
the Israelis to the extent that the Israelis would be willing
to settle for a cease-fire roughly along the present lines of
battle. This would be tantamount to a victory in Arab terms.
since it would shatter the myth of Israeli invincibility.
Moreover, while the Arabs may hope to ultimately regain
Palestine, even a few kilometers of Sinai could be regarded
as positive .movement in that direction.
For the Israelis a stalemate along the present lines of
battle would be tantamount psychologically to a military
defeat.
Implications for Third Parties
The interests of outside parties will be affected to
* - varying degrees by the current hostilities. The US and the
USSR, with the deepest involvement in the Middle East, are
both the most vulnerable and have thy most at stake. In
general, US interests in the Middle East will suffer, at
least in the .short run, and they could be seriously damaged
in the Arab states. The Soviets stand to lose the influence
they have built up in the area if they appear to be absent
in a time of dire Arab need. The West Europeans prefer to
remain uninvolved, but they are highly dependent on Arab oil
and .in the final analysis are prepared to do what appears
necessary to protect their oil supply. Japan's low profile,
aimed at preserving good relations with oil producing states,
will keep it largely unaffected unless the Arabs impose a
general oil embargo.
I ~ -
APPROVED FOR RELEASE - CIA INFO DATE 12
Two important general implications should be noted:
- Time is a critical element. The longer the fighting continues the greater will be the pressures on the.
US and USSR to intervene and for other Arab states, 4M
Jordan, to become involved in the fighting. There will
also be an increasing tendency to look for scapegoats and
foreign interests to lash out at. Also, the more destructive the war, the more difficult will be the post-war
- peace settlement effort.
- -- To the .extent that the superpowers become involved
in major military supply to the combatants, the chances
of a US-USSR confrontation will increase, as will the
Arab threats to embargo oil shipments and .other anti-US
actions. At the same time, because .of their identification with different sides of the conflict, the US and
USSR both have a need to demonstrate. a willingness to
fulfill commitments if they wish to be taken seriously
in the future.
Implications of Scenario I: Israeli. Retribution
If the Israelis are able to destroy the Syrian army
within the next .few days and then demolish the Egyptian armed
forces now in Sinai, US problems in the Arab world will increase. Anti-US reaction will be greatly magnified if there
is coincidence between US resupply of Israel and a decisive
turn in the tide of battle against the Arab forces.. The
Arab states would,- in these circumstances, see the US as a
major instrument in causing the Arab forces to lose the fruits
*of the one victory they have won over Israel--a victory which
involved the retaking of previously captured Arab territory.
The objective circumstances of .an Arab defeat would matter
little..
More specifically, the following would probably occur:
-- Oil producing states would attempt'to embargo oil
shipments to the US or at least reduce total oil output
by 'an amount equal. to that normally shipped to the US.
This would greatly increase competition among oil consuming states for available oil, since there is little
spare producing capacity in the world. However, an
effective embargo of oil to one country is very difficult
to enforce, and the Arab oil producing states would be
8
_$EGRET
PPROVED FOR RELEASE - CIA INFO DATE: 15-Oct-2012
hesitant to harm Western Europe.and Japan, even to get at the
US, as. long. as Europe and Japan stay neutral in the ctprent
conflict. The greater the magnitud.e of the Israeli Mtliagy
success, the more likely .it would be that oil producing states
would reduce shipments to Western Europe. ~In this case the
Europeans would have less refined products to export to the
US which would have an immediate impact on our current supply
problem. Even the threat of oil embargo would cause a number
of European governments to deny US overflights for military
resupply to Israel.
-- The chances of the US developing a cooperative longrange relationship with Saudi Arabia and other Arab oil
states in the Gulf; (whose output will be needed to supply
5 million bpd of projected oil imports by the late 1970s)
would be. put in serious jeopardy.
-- Pressure would mount on the USSR to come more directly
to the aid of the Syrians and Egyptians. (In 1967, the
USSR issued a vigorous warning to desist when it seemed
as if the Israelis might be prepared-to drive into Damascus.) If the Soviets backed away from the Arabs in their
time of need, they would in effect be writing off an area
of the world to which they have consistently given very
high priority.
* Implications of Scenario II: Stalemate
An outcome of the war in which Egyptian forces held some
territory on the East bank of the Suez Canal and the fighting
ended. without significant new Israeli territorial gains on
the Syrian front could be less damaging in.terms of Arab
attitudes toward the US than an Israeli victory that crushed
the Egyptian and Syrian military forces. But this. would only
be the case if the Israelis decided. on such a cease-fire soon
rather than as a result of being repulsed in an attempt to
take on the Egyptians in Sinai after destruction of the Syrian
forces.
More specifically:
-- The Israeli strategic military situation would be
relatively unchanged. They would still, for instance,
retain unilateral control over most of the Sinai buffer,
including the critical passes. The vulnerable Israeli
flanks to the north. (Syria and Lebanon) and east (Jordan)
-would still be protected by the results of the 1967 'war.
9.-
PPROVED FOR RELEASE - CIA INFO DATE: 15-Oct-2012
-- The Soviets would be off the spot with their Arab
friends, at least enough to avoid further direct intervention other than the emergency resupply of expendibles.
The Soviet position. in the Arab world would also emerge
from the war relatively unimpaired.
*-- The threat of an Arab oil embargo would be significantly reduced.-
-- A possibility might exist for starting a new effort
to promote a final settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict. The Israelis might finally come to realize that
over the long run the odds against their survival increase
unless they are able to reconcile their differences with.
the Arabs. The Arabs, having regained a measure of pride
and confidence, might begin to also think seriously about
going to the negotiating .table. In any event the Arabs
would not harbor the same bitter taste of complete defeat
that they have felt since 1967 and which led them.into
the .present fighting.
Over even the slightly long run it becomes very difficult,
if not impossible, to estimate the post-war situation in the
Middle East.. A.catalytic event like a-major war can result
in very important changes in the political environment that
present new opportunities for both the forces of peace and
instability. But most of how the war ends and the role of
* the super powers in ending or extending will determine the
future.

.IMPLICATIONS AND REACTEONS

A. The Oil Weapon and Its Effects
On 17 October the Organization. of Arab Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OAPEC) decided to cut oil production.
- Production will be reduced by not less than 5% a month
until an Israeli withdrawal from , occupied territories is
completed and the "legal rights" of the Palestinians are
restored;
- The Arab countries also promised to maintain oil deliveries
to "friendly" countries that give Arabs "effective material
help"; and
-- Threatened a total embargo of countries that used their
armed forces to aid Israel.
Many parts of the statement were left deliberately vague in brder to
allow each Arab country a degree of freedom to act according to its own
best interests. This ambiguity - similar to that of OPEC decisions in the
past - is intended to give the OAPEC agreement greater durability by giving
each country greater flexibility. All of the states are obliged to cut
production by 5% a month, but the way is open for some to make larger
cuts. The Arabs did not define those "friendly" countries that will continue
to receive normal imports from the Arab World. They probably will cut
back shipments to neutral states such as the United Kingdom and Japan
and may cut back shipments to such states as France and Italy that are
"tilting" their neutrality toward the Arabs. In any event, the final
interpretation of the definition is left to the individual producing country.
At least in the first months, the Arab monthly production cutback
will probably be between 5% and 10%, but closer to the 5% rate. Saudi
Arabia has reportedly already cut current production by 10%. Some other
countries - such as Iraq, which is unable to export most of its production
because of the closure of eastern Mediterranean ports - may make a virtue
of necessity and make very large initial cuts. An all-Arab cutback of between
5% and 10% would represent a loss of between one million and two million
barrels per day (b/d).
Several countries, including Libya, Abu Dhabi, Kuwait, and Saudi
Arabia, have either announced or threatened a total embargo against the
United States. However, the United States receives only about
1.6 million b/d of Arab oil (including products refined in Europe and the

Caribbean). Thus, even if the embargo were effective, the effect on the
United States would be relatively small, and, after the first month, the
brunt of the cutback would fall on Europe and Japan. Moreover, the US
companies that produce most Middle East oil might be able to shift supplies
among themselves to avoid the embargo. The companies .would, of course,
hesitate to do this for fear of jeopardizing their relations with the producing
countries as well as with Western Europe and Japan.
It seems inevitable that Western Europe and Japan will bear the brunt
of the progressive cutbacks. Western Europe is dependent on Arab oil for
70% of its consumption, and Japan depends on the Arabs for 40% of its
supply. The producer states recognize that it is "unjust" to punish Europe
and Japan more severely than the United States, but see no other alternative.
The Saudis have informed representatives of the major West European
nations that they will te expected to pressure the United States. They have
also suggested to the Japanese that they make a statement before the UN
General Assembly to the effect that Japan desires an early settlement to
the war and that it supports the Arab position.
From the point of view of United States vulnerability, it is Ierhaps
fortunate that this particular crisis occurred now rather than a few years
hence. It had been predicted that we would be importing nearly 5 million
barrels per day of Arab oil or 21%-22% of our consumption by 1980. With
this level of exports an Arab cutoff would severely affect our economy.
Even now there are domestic as well as foreign pressures for policy changes
as a result of the current cutoff. In any event, the rapid increase in the
price of imported oil should dampen our consumption and make other
domestic energy sources more attractive, for example oil from Colorado
shales and coal gasification.
Although the West European countries are attempting to form a
common position regarding the oil cutback, division tendencies may prove
too strong. Joint contingency plans exist, but, because of the different
countries' different views of their own advantage, the plans may not be
used efectively. Individual countries also have developed plans for dealing
with a crisis on a national basis. Some reportedly are updating rationing
systems worked out during earlier crises and have stocks of rationing books
ready for distribution. At the same time, a few European countries, notably
France, still entertain hopes that the Arab oil production cutback will not
apply to them.
The immediate impact from war damage and production cutbacks will
vary considerably among EC members. The shutdown of three eastern
Mediterranean pipelines already has dropped Italy's oil imports by some

24% and France's by 14%, while affecting other members' imports only
moderately or not at all. Because of the large difference in shipping
distances, those nations such as West Germany that depend most heavily
on North African oil will feel the pinch of a production cutback much
sooner than those such as the Benelux countries that depend on Persian
Gulf .supplies (see the table). Italy already has imposed an embargo on
refined oil exports outside the EC - a move detrimental to US supplies
that may be emulated by other Community members if the supply situation
worsens.
Over the next few months, the impact of reduced oil imports will
be partly mitigated by reserve stocks maintained by the EC nations. All
have about a two-month supply on hand, and France reportedly has a 90-day
reserve. Arab oil, however, accounts for between 63% and 78% of EC
members' oil imports and a similar share of their total consumption. As
a result, a 5%-10% cumulative monthly reduction in production by the Arab
states, together with already interrupted pipeline deliveries, would soon
force EC nations to draw heavily on riserve stocks. If current consumption
levels were maintained, these reserves might be depleted within six months,
and total available supplies could be reduced to one-half of normal.
Conservation measures could delay the depletion of reserves by at most
another few months.

Clearly such a production cutback, if it persisted for a number of
months, would require some belt tightening. But, the analysis shows that
by moderate belt tightening and drawing down existing stocks of petroleum,
we can avoid a serious crisis this winter. This posture is illustrated best
by Figure 5, which shows that a 5% reduction in consumption in the United
States and a 10% reduction in consumption in Western Europe and Japan,
together with stock drawdowns and a 300,000 barrel per day combined,
surge in the United States and Venezuelan production, even Western Europe
and Japan would not face a real crisis for some time.
This does not mean that there would not be dislocations and regional
problems in the United States as well as in Western Europe. For example,
heating oil problems in the United States east coast would worsen somewhat.
Moreover, the United States would come under considerable pressure
to share to some extent with Western Europe and Japan if they should
come to believe that their supplies were to be cut back for several months.
In this event our own belt tightening might have to. be greater than the
5% shown in the illustration.

B; The Impact of Increased Oil Prices
The increase in oil prices will be felt primarily in the United States,
Japan, and Western Europe. The oil import bills of the United States and
Japan will each increase by about S3 billion, while the additional cost to
Western Europe will approach S8 billion. This assumes that deliveries from
the Gulf will continue as scheduled prior to the announcement of
production limitations.
- The oil price rise will turn an expected S I billion or so 1974
US trade surplus into a roughly $2 billion deficit
The Canadian trade balance will be virtually unaffected
because Canadian oil imports are roughly equal to exports
Japan, which imports about 43% of its oil from the Arab
countries, will have a 1974 surplus of about $3 billion,
compared with a previous estimate of $6 billion.
- The West Germans will pay an additional cost of about
$1.8 billion - the highest in Europe - but they will feel
the least hardship because their 1974 trade surplus will be
on the order of $8 billion.
- Petroleum imports will push the UK trade deficit from about
$3.5 billion to almost $5 billion.
- The OPEC action will add $1.5 billion to the oil import
bill of both France and Italy. The price increases will reduce
the French surplus to near zero. Italy's small deficit in 1973
was expected to narrow further but should now be in the
$1.5 billion-S2 billion range.
Some of the impact of higher oil prices in the consuming countries
will be offset by greater repatriation of oil company profits and larger
exports to the producers, generated by their greater export income. Only
part of the worldwide producer revenue increases of $15 billion will be
spent, however. The 1974 oil revenues of Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, Qatar,
and Kuwait will approach the amounts recently estimated for 1980. These
countries have only limited absorptive capacities.
Although the trade balances of the oil importers will deteriorate
sharply, the impact on their domestic economies will probably be slight.
Oil imports do not compete with domestic production so there should be
no initial offsetting loss in jobs. The consuming countries' non-petroleum
trade and production will essentially be the same as before the oil price

increase. Moreover, the sharp rise in crude oil prices should not significantly
increase the price of finished goods.
The use to which the oil producers put their reserves could have an
appreciable impact on the international exchange rate system and, through
the exchange system,ultimately on the volume of exports and imports.
If, for example, the producers decide to-hold most of their increased receipts
in dollars, the dollar will strengthen in exchange markets. A dollar
appreciation means more expensive - and therefore reduced - US exports.
In effect, the oil producers will be converting their trade surpluses with
other consumers into trade surpluses with the United States; or, in another
view, the US trade account with Japan, Canada, and Western Europe will
deteriorate by the amount 'of the increase in their oil import bills.
As the oil producers' reserves increase, their threat to exchange markets
will also increase. The Arab oil states already have enough liquid foreign
assets - around SS-S7 billion ' to temporarily disrupt currency markets.
Although there is no evid'ence of any substantial dollar sales during the
current crisis, and an attack on the dollar would result in the depreciation
of the Arabs' own reserve holding, it is not inconceivable that - if the
political and military situation becomes increasingly unacceptable to them -
the Arab leadership would move against the dollar. On Thursday, Libya
publicly called for concerted Arab dollar sales and withdrawal of deposits
from US banks.

C. Foreign Reaction
Western Europe
There is very little the West Europeans can do in the near term to
get their oil deliveries back to strength. They will, of course, continue to
distance themselves from Washington's present Middle Eastern policy - in
speeches, in UN votes, and in the denial of overflight and refueling rights
- for US military aircraft. But no European leader expects such behavior to
cause Washington to rethink its position or entirely to save Europe from
the effects of the oil embargo. Indeed, the West Europeans probably are
overly conscious of their impotence to influence the present situation; they
are more inclined to "keep their heads low" in the hope of warding off
still greater threats to their energy supply.
At the moment, the West Europeans are eager to discuss oil problems
with the United States, hoping naturally that the United States will agree I
to share supplies (and shortages). But if such agreements are not forthcoming
from Washington - and if oil shortages begin to bite severely - the
Europeans would try at least to keep all the oil they can get for themselves
by reducing or eliminating their exports of refined oil to the United States.
In such a scramble, they would be more likely to act unilaterally than
on a joint European-wide basis.
There is some inconsistency between the European desire to minimize
association with US political policy in the Middle East crisis and European
awareness that some form of cooperation arrangement for coping with oil
shortage must necessarily involve US-European conversation. This
inconsistency is both real and apparent. The Europeans will try to resolve
it insofar as they can, by working for quiet talks within OECD forum on
oil matters, while avoiding political initiatives unless and until the time seems
ripe for a mediation role that would not alienate the Arabs.
Over the longer run, the present experience will further encourage the
West Europeans to decrease their reliance on the major oil companies and
to develop instead their own arrangements with oil producing governments.
They would focus on offers of government-to-government agreements that
would involve European technical assistance in return for supply
commitments, and possibly trade preferences for oil producing states. An
obvious side effect of such a policy would be lessened European willingness
to join in consumer cooperation schemes on terms favorable to the United
States or - depending on US-Arab relations in the postwar world - be
associated with the United States in oil cooperation schemes on any terms
at all.

Japan
The Japanese have always sought to avoid taking sides in contentious
situations involving Middle East oil. In the last year, the Japanese have
refused to join an oil consumers organization, for fear of antagonizing the
oil producers in OPEC. There has been an ongoing debate in Japan for
some time over the merits of multilateral versus go it alone approaches
to assuring oil supplies.
Japan's policy in regard to the present petroleum supply situation rests
almost entirely on the hope that the current Middle East crisis can be
defused before severe sanctions are enacted by the Arabs. Tokyo is being
urged by the Arab states, with Saudi Arabia taking the lead, to issue an
official statement supporting the Arab position in the current conflict. The
Arabs have avoided accompanying such requests with threats of a serious
disruption in the flow of oil to Japan. Nevertheless, the implied threat of
economic blackmail has not been lost on the Japanese. The Japanese are
extremely reluctant to abandon their neutral position on the Middle East
primarily because of the serious impact such a step would have onlelations
with the United States, in particular with regard to existing plans for
bilateral cooperation in the field of energy-petroleum sharing. Foreign
Minister Ohira, on 19 October, sought to sidestep an Arab request for direct
political support when he told a group of Arab envoys that Japan favors
settlement through the United Nations and noted that Japan supported the
1967 Security Council resolution calling for Israeli withdrawal from
occupied Arab territory.
Tokyo's political tightrope walk will have difficulty surviving an
indefinite prolongation or heightening of Arab pressure. If backed to the
wall by credible Arab threats of a cut off of oil, the Japanese will probably
give in. As a contingency measure, the Japanese Government is already
studying drafts of a statement supporting the Arab position that could be
used in such a forum as the UN General Assembly. But Japan would first
make a last ditch effort to secure assistance from the United States in the
form of diversion of some US oil supplies to Japanese needs.

C ARAB STATES - ISRAEL: The cease-fire appears
to be working on the Syrian front, but fighting continued through most of yesterday on the Egyptian
front south of the Great Bitter Lake on both banks
of the Suez Canal.
25X1 units of
the Egyptian Third Army on the east bank of the
canal launched a two-pronged, tank-supported attack
east toward the Gidi and Mitla passes, and reportedly
made some significant gains before being halted by
Israeli forces. 25X1
25X1
There is no clear indication, however, as to what
positions the forces involved in the Egyptian thrust
now hold.
Other elements of the Third Army reportedly attacked north along the east bank of the Great Bitter
Lake in an attempt to link u with the Egyptian Second Army. 25X1
25X1
Israeli forces yesterday morning captured the
Egyptian naval base at Adabiyah, south of Suez city.
Fighting continued in and around Suez city yesterday, with the Israelis claiming to have thwarted an
attempt by Egyptian forces there to break out. Earlier in the day, Egyptian armored forces on the west
bank launched an unsuccessful operation to reopen
the road from Cairo to Suez, apparently in an attempt to relieve the Egyptian troops at Suez and
open a bridgehead to the Third Army on the east
bank. According to an Israeli spokesman, some 28
Egyptian aircraft attacked Israeli positions an
hour before the ground attacks. Tel Aviv claims
to have shot down 14 of the attackers. By nightfall, fighting had died down to sporadic artillery
fire.
Large Egyptian forces apparently remain within
the Israeli enclave on the west bank of the canal.

C At last night's Security Council session, eight
nonaligned states presented a resolution which would
create a UN emergency peacekeeping force for the Middle East. Their resolution would also enlarge the
existing UN observer force and repeat earlier calls
for an immediate cease-fire and withdrawal to positions held at 1750 GMT Monday.
Earlier in the meeting Egypt had requested Soviet and US troops to enforce the cease-fire. The
Soviet Union argued that the request was justified
by continued Israeli violations of the truce, but
the Soviets made no promise to provide supervisory
forces. The nonaligned states, which have been resentful of US-Soviet dominance of Security Council
actions, then weighed in with their proposal. The
council is scheduled to reconvene at 1030 this morning to debate the draft. If approved, it may
strengthen the policing of the much-violated ceasefire, which has no enforcement provisions, and is
supervised only by UN observers in the area under
the 1967 mandate.
All seven UN observation teams presently planned
for the Egyptian side of the cease-fire line have
been dispatched and are reporting. The situation
is confused, however, because most teams are not
certain where the opposing front lines are, and
three teams on the southern sector have been held
up by an armored battle northwest of Suez city. Israel is delaying efforts to establish stations on
the east bank; no observer patrols have reached
that area.
On the Syrian front, Damascus has pushed hard
to have observation teams installed along the Israeli bulge into Syrian territory, and the initial
UN plan is to have three posts on each side of the
salient. The new posts will be manned from those
previously closed and will not require additional
personnel.

Despite China's harsh description of the UN
cease-fire resolution as a ploy to bolster superpower
hegemony in the Middle East, the Chinese have not
tried to block either cease-fire call, undoubtedly
out of deference to Arab wishes. Throughout the
fighting the Chinese have kept a low profile, limiting themselves to strong verbal support for the Arabs
and pledges of additional economic aid to Egypt.
From the beginning the Chinese ruled out donating any
but token military assistance. Fully conscious of
its limited ability to influence events in the Middle
East, Peking has had to be content with positioning
itself to profit from any Arab dissatisfaction with
the policies of the superpowers, particularly the
USSR.
The US Embassy in Beirut has noted indecision
on the part of fedayeen spokesmen as to how to reconcile their public rejection of the cease-fire resolution with maintenance of good relations with
their Arab supporters who accepted it. Pro-fedayeen
press commentators are not directly attacking the
cease-fire, but are glorifying those who have-rejected it. In calling for a continuation of the
"struggle" rather than "war," the fedayeen may now
be moderating their position--or at least disguising
it--to guarantee continued support from Arab benefactors such as Egypt and Syria.

ARAB STATES - ISRAEL: Except for a few scattered
exchanges near Suez city, which is still in Egyptian
hands, both the Egyptian and Syrian fronts were relatively calm again yesterday.
The Israelis claim to have shot down two Egyptian
,helicopters over the Gulf of Suez as they attempted to
reach the Third Army at dawn; a third helicopter apparently made it through. A UN convoy of 24 trucks passed
through Israeli lines and reached besieged Egyptian
units in SuE. '-n+ n- ann mid-9ay. The Syrian front
was quiet. 25X1 25X1
Radio Jerusalem announced that Israeli and.Egyptian officers would meet again today mainly to discuss
an exchange of POWs. The public mood in Israel reportedly has begun to harden on the POW issue. The
government has been stung by opposition critics in
the Knesset who have accused it of giving in to US
pressure to permit relief of the 'Egyptian Third Army
while obtaining nothing in return. Several influential
Israeli contacts have told US officials in Tel Aviv that
the Israeli Government will not agree to anything else
until the US persuades Cairo and Moscow to make some
tangible concessions on the POWs. Tel Aviv also wants
the alleged Arab blockade of the Straits of Bab el
Mandeb at the southern tip of the Gulf of 'Suez lifted,
according to these sources.;
Syrian President Asad told his nation yesterday
that the cease-fire had taken him by surprise, but
that he had agreed to accept it after the Soviets and
President Sadat gave him guarantees that Israel would
withdraw completely from all occupied Arab territory.
Asad acclaimed the cease-fire as a victory for the
Arab side, but threatened to renew the fighting if
Syria did not obtain its objectives by negotiations.

CThe Syrian President made several oblique references
to internal opposition, warning that a split in Syria's ranks would endanger the country's diplomatic
and military gains.
At the UN, Secretary General Waldheim is running
into difficulties assembling a 7,000-man international
force. The 585 peacekeeping troops now in the Middle
East have been drawn from the UN force on Cyprus and
are being paid out of the Cyprus peacekeeping fund.
Numerous states have offered troops, but most of them
have been rejected either because they belong to the
Warsaw Pact or NATO, or because they do not have diplomatic relations with Israel. Waldheim, therefore,
will have to organize a force made up of a patchquilt
of small states such as Panama, Finland, and Indonesia,
which will be a time-consuming job. One important
obstacle to funding the force was overcome last night
when the Soviet Union agreed to help pay for the operation as long as it is kept under tight Security
Council countrol. 25X1

ARAB STATES - ISRAEL: General quiet prevailed
on he battlefront over the weekend, despite sporadic
cease-fire violations and continued preparations by
both sides for a possible resumption of hostilities.
Arab oil producers underscored their political war
with an additional production cutback.
The Syrian front was quiet, probably because
of heavy rains there, but occasional minor outbreaks
of fighting continued through the weekend along
the Suez Canal. The Israelis claim that on 3 November the surrounded Egyptian Third Army tried to
construct a small infantry bridge across the canal
from the east bank between Suez and Little Bitter
Lake. According to the Israelis, the bridging effort
was given up following a three-hour artillery, mortar, and small arms duel.
Yesterday, a UN patrol reported fighting near
Suez, as 200-300 Egyptian troops pushed out of the
city and were engaged by Israeli infantry and tank
units. UN observers also reported hearing heavy
explosions near Ismailia, and the Israelis complained that the Egyptians had opened fire on their
forces near the city.

Israeli spokesmen warned repeatedly that Egyptian actions could lead to a major breakdown in
the cease-fire. Defense Minister Dayan yesterday
accused Egyptian forces of mobilizing on the west
bank, and.Foreign Minister Eban--in an airport
statement before departing for a four-day visit to
Romania--warned that the cease-fire cannot be considered stable so long as freedom of navigation 's
not assured through the Strait of Bab al-Mandab.

In a move probably designed to step up political pressure before the Secretary's visit, Arab oil
ministers announced a 25-percent production cutback
based on September's production figures. Saudi
Arabia, with the 10-percent limitation imposed in
mid-October and the additional embargoes of shipments to the US and the Netherlands, had already
reached the 25-percent level, and the new formulation appears to strengthen King Faysal's leadership
role. by committing the other producers to match his
cutback. The move may be designed to bring countries such as Libya, Algeria, and Iraq, which have
not been rigorously enforcing the earlier limitation, into line. If adhered to, it will increase
the overall Arab cutback in November by some five
percent over that already in effect.

Cof service for each of their contingents may be more
complicated than usual because of the number of developing states which have not taken part in earlier
peace-keeping operations.
The problem of how to pay for UNEF is also unresolved. The US Mission to the UN has found little
support for the proposal that costs of the operation
be apportioned among UN members according to the
regular scale of assessments. Less-developed states
are likely to support instead a Brazilian proposal
making developed countries, particularly permanent
Council members, responsible for 98 percent of the
costs. Since there is no available cash on hand in
the UN treasury, a delay in agreement on some system
of assessing funds for UNEF could stall the entire
operation.

(ARAB STATES - ISRAEL: Egyptian and Israeli
representatives are to meet again today at Kilometer
101 to continue yesterday's 3 -hour discussion concerning a mutual pullback of forces. Neither country has officially commented on yesterday's session,
but Cairo's chief representative, General Gamasy,
told reporters afterward that each side presented
two alternative proposals for a pullback. He said
"some" differences between the two sides remain, but
noted: "We are still trying." Cairo domestic radio,
meanwhile, broadcast a report on the meeting, citing
UN General Siilasvuo's comment that the discussions
were "beneficial."
Apparently in anticipation of difficulties at
Thursday's military talks, Egypt had earlier:
-- publicly accused Israel of obstructing implementation of the six-point agreement, and forecast that Thursday's talks would be "decisive";
--publicized a four-hour meeting Wednesday between President Sadat and his highest military
advisers;
-taken foreign military attaches on .a .14-hour
tour of canal-front military positions in order
to show Egyptian preparedness.
Egypt nevertheless completed, along with Israel,
the exchange of prisoners, and its official spokesman
expressed hope that an Arab-Israeli peace conference
would begin "within the next few weeks."
Syria, while expressing through Foreign Minister
Khaddam its intention to attend a peace conference
"if it is convened in accordance with our concept,"
appeared to be improving its military positions facing
the Israelis. On 21 November UN observers reported
that the Syrian Army was bringing more troops into
an area northwest of Sasa. The observers said the
Syrians, who had previously been anxious to have UN
patrols along the cease-fire line west of Sasa, no

I fClonger wished a patrol in an area about six miles
northwest of the town. The UN observers also noted
that the Syrian chief of staff "probably will not
permit continued mobile patrols"; such a restriction
would significantly reduce UN coverage of the Syrian
side of the cease-fire line, because all such patrols
along the Sasa salient are mobile.

Asked on
21 November if he expects military action in view
of Israel's "obstinate" stand, Foreign Minister -
Khaddam, who visited Cairo last weekend, said only
that Syria's battle with Israel embraces military,
political, and economic means, which complement
each other. Syrian President Asad is to make a oneday visit to Cairo today to-meet with President
Sadat. According to Egyptian press reports, Asad
will then fly to Algiers to attend the Arab summit
conference to begin on 26 .November.
Both.Syria and Egypt appeared confident that
Cairo's position on how to deal with current issues
would prevail at the Algiers conference. Iraq and
Libya are the only countries not attending, and the
possibility of lower level Libyan representation remains open. Egypt's semiofficial Al Ahram called
on all Arab states to attend the conference, stressing the need to maintain solidarity and preserve the
new Arab image achieved as a result of the October
war.

NOTE FOR THE RECORD:
SUBJECT 30 November Interagency Review of
Middle East Photo Reconnaissance Planning
1. A meeting of interagency representatives was called by the
National Intelligence Officer (NIO) for the Middle East on 30 November to
effect final review and coordination for a GIANT REACH mission authorized
to be flown during the coming week (2-8 December). iZ i (NIO)
was unable to attend because of last minute developments and he asked
that the meeting be chaired by Chairman, COMIREX--which was done. 25X1A
2. The following points were conveyed to the representatives:
a. On 29 November Dr. Kissinger approved the 21 November
73 memorandum containing a recommended plan for Middle East
Photo Reconnaissance which had been prepared under the DCI's
auspices. While the plan was approved as a package, it was understood that the' specific schedule (paragraph 12.a.) was approved in
principle subject to a check and approval before each individual
flight.
b. A specific GIANT REACH mission was approved for the
coming week (2-8 December).
c . Dr. Kissinger also indicated that the mechanism for
coordinating and reviewing the need for future SR-71 flights in
this package was to be handled through the NIO for the Middle East.

a. The earliest date on which a GIANT REACH mission can
be flown is Sunday, 2 December. This date was set as the objective,
subject only to the presence of adequate weather conditions in the
target areas. There was agreement that 50/50 weather would be used
as the general criterion and that close pre-mission coordination
between SAC and Washington DoD elements would be affected to make
a decision if weather conditions were below this threshold. 25X1 D

The representative also raised the possibility of
renewed fighting along the Suez front. Waldheim also
met with US, Soviet, and Israeli UN representatives
late yesterday. What, if any, success UN efforts to
bring the two sides together again might have is unclear, but press reports cite Egyptian officials as
saying it is now up to Washington and Moscow to salvage the situation by persuading Israel to be more
forthcoming on the issue of troop withdrawals in the

UN forces patrolling the southern Suez front
have reported a marked upswing in the number of
cease-fire violations over the past several days,
according to a UN spokesman in Cairo. An Israeli
military officer also told the press that the Suez
front was "warming up," and Tel Aviv reported that
Israeli forces came under Egyptian fire five times
yesterday, resulting in one Israeli wounded. Most
clashes, however, appeared to be localized affairs
involving small-arms fire, although some mortar and
artillery fire was also exchanged.
In a speech to American Jewish leaders in
Jerusalem, Prime Minister Meir repeated a number of
her well-known views on the Arab-Israeli question,
including her objections to international guarantees
as a substitute for defensible borders. She said
that she is not convinced that fighting will not be
resumed, although she hopes it will not. After
stating that she had not perceived a single genuine
call for peace comming from this week's Arab summit
in Algiers, she indicated that Israel is nonetheless
ready to take part in the proposed Geneva peace conference.
The Israeli scenario for the conference was
spelled out by Foreign Minister Eban in an interview
with an Israeli newspaper. He expects it to convene
in Geneva on schedule on 18 December, with Gromyko
and Kissinger attending the opening session along with the foreign ministers of Israel, Jordan, Syria,
Egypt, and possibly Lebanon. The conference would
then adjourn until after the Israeli Government received a negotiating mandate in the 31 December
elections. Eban said that he expected the peace
conference to go on for months after reconvening
in January, with this second phase attended by permanent delegations of professional diplomats who

Cwould deal with specific problems between Israel
and individual Arab states as well as conduct discussions among the Arabs themselves.
Eban insisted that Israel would not accept the
participation in the peace conference of PLO leader
Yasir Arafat, even though the Arab summit had recognized the PLO as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. Instead, he suggested that Palestinian representatives be included in the Jordanian
delegation--the very concept that was rejected by
the Arab summit.
The US consul in Jerusalem reported on 30 November that Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied
1 West Bank are rapidly coming around to the view that
at the peace conference the PLO should negotiate for
all Palestinians. They reportedly also feel that an
independent West Bank - Gaza state should emerge
with PLO leadership, and that Jordan's King Husayn
should not be the Palestinians' negotiator or ruler.
Informed journalists think that, in the wake of the
Algiers summit, an overwhelming majority of the
normally politically fragmented West Bankers favor
these ideas, while the remainder are reluctant to
speak out in opposition.
In such an atmosphere, there is considerable
expectation that the PLO will try to broaden its
base by adding West Bank personalities to its Palestinian National Assembly. The upsurge of expressed
support for the PLO and a separate state apparently
has been stimulated by the widespread assumption
that now, for the first time, it is worthwhile for
the West Bankers themselves to decide what they
want, regardless

ARAB STATES - ISRAEL: Syria's announcement
yesterday that it would not participate in the
Geneva conference which begins Friday reflected the
ingrained convictions of important elements in

still not possible.

on the Golan front, 25X1
25X1 25X1
the
possibility exists that Egypt and Syria mig t advance their timetable for putting direct military
pressure on Israel to hasten its withdrawal from
Arab territory.
Egypt's reaction to the announcement, however,
held out the hope that the Syrians could be persuaded to come to Geneva later, if sufficient progress could be made to dispel their doubts. In an
official statement, Cairo expressed an understanding of the "fear and suspicion that have forced"
Syria not to attend the conference. The statement,
nevertheless, emphasized that significant progress
during the initial meetings in Geneva could open
the way for Syria and other Arabs to contribute
positively to the peace effort. The message warned,
however, that procrastination and stalling by the
Israelis would force the Arabs to resume their
armed struggle.
According to press reports from Geneva, Israeli
officials reaffirmed Israel's agreement to attend
the conference, despite Syria's decision to stay
away.
